# marwa-brush
Now, in order to be eligible for the Athena Award, you must have a detailed and descriptive README in your GitHub repo. Doesn't have to be a MLA-formatted essay, but it should have the following:
What your project is/does (and what it's called)
Why you made your project
How you made your project
What you struggled with and what you learned

Hiii to anyone reading this, my project is the ultimate Marwa Brush, which is definitely would be a lie if you click the link and see that it is like the most basic Javascript brush ever. However, it is a slightly large feat for me, as for a few months after using Javascript in Girls Who Code (GWC), I was like, nope, never again. However, this is a limiting belief, and won't really improve my website-making skills if I'm just super-pro at static websites, so I decided to take on the journey to overcome my fear of Javascript and make a simple, circular brush with a few toggles such as a color, size, transparency (aka alpha, like me), undo, redo, and clear buttons. I also decided to make this project with minimal HTML and CSS because I wanted to focus on the Javascript part (but I do like my websites to be aesthetic).

Well, this project didn't last long as I thought I did. I mean I needed guidance to build the brush itself, so I decided to search for video to help me teach the basic layout (where I learned that you can use something called <canvas> to create a drawing grid), and then built on off of that using other tutorials (+ help from others lol), and I learned a lot of different functions in Javascript (like did you know that Javascript had a built in function for a color picker?), and I realized that maybe, coders did want to implement digital art into the digital world (the <canvas> kind of gave it away). They probably added all these terms to initially confuse others (me included, yikes), but I mean if you properly learn what each of them does, then you'll be fine. I just think that Javascript concepts are overall more abstract than HTML and CSS, so you have to do a small bit of research and asking for help. Overall, the universal theme I understood from this is that you probably have to do the things you're like... really scared to do. This is under the umbrella of procastination, a topic I covered in my other website, marwa-tutorial, but instead of procastination due to tediousness, it's more so a procastination due to fear and anxiety of failing. I feel like identifying what you're scared of is the first step, and then you have to just do that no matter how nerve-wrecking it is. 

It might not seem that bad, I thought I was going to spend decades on this due to Javascript, but it only took me around 2 days (since I had tutorials and friends to guide me ^_^)


Oh man, sorry for being like Socrates or something... Anyway I'm doing this for Athena in Hack Club!!! This is my third project, and I already completed my 30 hour requirement I'm so excited!!!!
